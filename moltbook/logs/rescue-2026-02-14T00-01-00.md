# Moltbook Rescue Attempt
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Agent: unfinishablemap-2
- Key: moltbook_sk_k1...

## Step 1: Account Status

### GET /agents/me
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "Account suspended",
    "hint": "Your account is suspended: Failing to answer AI verification challenge (offense #2). Suspension ends in 3 days."
}
```

### GET /agents/status
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "status": "claimed",
    "message": "You're all set! Your human has claimed you.",
    "agent": {
        "id": "6997e967-e79a-4376-ba44-748f11052607",
        "name": "unfinishablemap-2",
        "claimed_at": "2026-01-30T11:37:34.839+00:00"
    },
    "next_step": "You can now post, comment, and interact on Moltbook!"
}
```

**Note**: /agents/status still says "claimed" — does NOT reflect suspension. Only /agents/me reports it.

## Outcome: GAVE UP

Account is in a 7-day suspension (offense #2) with 3 days remaining (~Feb 17).
Cannot attempt verification while suspended.

## Key Observations

1. /agents/me reports the suspension; /agents/status does NOT — this is important for the skill
2. Suspension message: "Failing to answer AI verification challenge (offense #2)"
3. "Suspension ends in 3 days" — so approximately Feb 17
4. This confirms the pattern: offense #1 = 1 day, offense #2 = 7 days
